# Text Mining Adverse Drug Reactions from Social Media
According to the Food and Drug Administration agency, ADRs are a major public health concern and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Currently, information relating to ADRs is fragmented and curated manually from distributed and heterogeneous resources such as social media (online forums). The aim of this project is to extract entities involved in ADRs (diseases, symptoms, drugs, treatments) from social media using text mining tools. In addition, sentiment analysis (positive, negative) can also help to distinguish ADRs as postings indicate negative feelings.
